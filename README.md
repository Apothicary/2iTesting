# 2iTesting

This is the 2iTesting Programming Repository 

I have completed the coding challenge using Java. <br/> Looking at the challenge I took that the user was to give two inputs. One being A and the other X. <br/>
The first iteration would require displaying the multiples of A X number of times. <br/> The second iteration would add 1 to the value of A and then display the multiples of A as double the value X (2X). <br/> The third iteration would add 2 to the value of A and then display the multiples of A as triple the value of X (3X).
